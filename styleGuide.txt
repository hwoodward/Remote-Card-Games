This is the basic naming conventions and other guidleines to keep code in the repository looking consistent and liegibl
e. If something isn't clear it should be in more detail in the wiki, if not ask Helen for clarification.

Using idle for spacing - 4 space indents, no tab characters
No spaces after """ in docstrings
1 line doc strings have ending quotes in line, mult line docstrings have first line in-line with opening quotes, and cl
osing quotes on their own line

Naming conventions:
folder names: lowercase (preferably one word)
file names: CapWords format
class names: CapWords (remember that import statements look like "from folder.path.FileName import ClassName" when naming)
method names (functions in classes): Prefix_mixCase or Upper_Case depending on if there is a prefix.
    note: Prefix is usually either Send or Network, adn then the mixCase is the actionName being sent/recieved

instance variables (variable stored in an instance of a class): lower_case

functions outside of a class: Upper_Case
variables outside of a class  - theoretically Upper_Case, but the ones in the RunServer/RunClient are mixedCase right n
ow b/c I'm treating those as mostly one giant function, they should be refactored to have a 'main' method which would m
ake this all consistent again

methodArguments (what you pass in to a method): mixedCase
    remember the 1st argument to an instance method is self, and the first argument to a class method is cls 

internal variables (stuff that is only in scope for a specific method or clause's duration): mixedCase

actionNames for network communications should all by mixedCase to help fit with the methodNames.
names for properties/keys in the json objects passed in the actions/API calls shoud be lower_case and matching the variables that will store that info is acceptable/encouraged
