# Remote-Card-Games
Utilities for playing card games online/remotely. Goal is to play a game of hand and foot with multiple groups in different locations.

## Dependencies
First the obvious: This is written in python, so you must have python installed on any machine running it.

We also used a few python libraries that must be installed. I recommend using pip to install them, but they are open source repositories if you want to build them yourself.

Python libraries required:
* podsixnet (for server/client communication)
